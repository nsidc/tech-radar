# Tech Radar

The Tech Radar helps NSIDC understand the spectrum of technology that is relevant to our work. It is intended to facilitate internal conversations about technology and tools as we build and maintain code bases. It reflects the idiosyncratic opinions of its contributors not a consensus of NSIDC. It is meant to be used for guidance rather than as a prescription or standard.

## Usage

We are using the [Discussion](https://github.com/nsidc/tech-radar/discussions) feature of GitHub to maintain the content of the radar.

### Creating and Organizing Content

Initally we are dividing content into four categories: 

- Languages and Frameworks
  - Programming Languages and Frameworks
- Platforms
  - Things that we build on top of such as mobile technologies like Android, virtual platforms like the JVM, or generic kinds of platforms like hybrid clouds.
- Techniques
  - These include elements of a process, such as experience design; and ways of structuring software, such as microservices.
- Tools
  - These can be components, such as databases, software development tools, such as versions control systems; or more generic categories of tools, such as the notion of polyglot persistence.

Each item should also receive at least one of the following labels. _It is likely that an item will have multiple labels, **that is okay**!_ This landscape is complex with many different opinions and use cases.

- Interested
  - We are keeping an eye on the technology
- Using - Recommended
  - Using in a current project or production code base. Would recommend it
- Using - Not recommended
  - Using in a current project or production code base. Would not recommend it
- Deprecated
  - Using in a production code base. Want to avoid new work using the technology
- Not Using
  - We made an active decision not to use at the moment

### Using the Tech Radar

- As a contributor
  - Adding new content
    - Check to see if item is on the Radar, if not create a [new Discussion](https://github.com/nsidc/tech-radar/discussions/new/choose) and add at least one label.
  - Adding your opinon to an existing item
    - Use the [Discussion tools](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/participating-in-a-discussion) to offer and discuss opinions
  - Highlighting a summary of our opinions
    - Add a comment that summarizes the conversation to that point and [mark it as the Answer](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/moderating-discussions#marking-a-comment-as-an-answer)
- As a viewer
  - Following a item
    - Use the Subscribe feature on a Discussion to be notified when there is conversation about an item.

### Improving the Tech Radar

We use the [Issues](https://github.com/nsidc/tech-radar/issues) feature to manage the Tech Radar meta.
